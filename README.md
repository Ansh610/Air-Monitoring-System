# Air-Monitoring-System

##A smart air monitoring system is an advanced solution designed to continuously track and analyze air quality in real-time. These systems utilize a variety of sensors to measure key air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), along with temperature and humidity.

##Functionality:
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously collects and transmits data on air quality.
Data Processing: Analyzes sensor data to provide meaningful insights.
Alerts and Notifications: Warns users of hazardous air quality levels.
Visualization: Displays data through dashboards or apps for easy interpretation.
